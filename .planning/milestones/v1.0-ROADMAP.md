# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-26
**Phases:** 1-2
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a command-line TODO manager in two phases. Phase 1 establishes the foundation with JSON storage and week-based task organization. Phase 2 builds the complete CLI interface for managing tasks. The result is a simple, reliable tool for managing weekly tasks from the command line.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Core Storage & Task Model

**Goal**: Establish reliable JSON-based task storage with week-based organization
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: STOR-01, STOR-02, STOR-03, TASK-01, TASK-03, ERR-02
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Foundation modules (Task model, week utilities, storage layer)
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Integration testing and verification

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Tasks are persisted to a JSON file with auto-generated IDs
2. Tasks are organized by week boundaries (Monday-Sunday)
3. File read errors are caught and reported with clear messages
4. File write errors are caught and reported with clear messages
5. Task data can be loaded from the JSON file on subsequent runs

### Phase 2: CLI Operations

**Goal**: Provide complete command-line interface for managing weekly tasks
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: CLI-01, CLI-02, CLI-03, CLI-04, CLI-05, TASK-02, TASK-04, TASK-05, ERR-01
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — CLI interface with add, list, complete, delete commands

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. User can add tasks via `python todo.py add "task text"`
2. User can list current week's tasks via `python todo.py list`
3. User can mark tasks complete via `python todo.py complete <id>` (displayed crossed off)
4. User can delete tasks via `python todo.py delete <id>`
5. Invalid commands show usage help
6. Invalid task IDs show clear error messages

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Use uuid.uuid4() for task IDs (more robust than sequential numbers) — 01-01
- Week boundaries: Monday (weekday 0) to Sunday (weekday 6) — 01-01
- JSON structure: {"tasks": [...]} for future extensibility — 01-01
- Error handling returns empty list vs. raising exceptions — 01-01
- Simple assertion-based tests over test framework (zero dependencies) — 01-02
- Use argparse with subparsers for intuitive command structure — 02-01
- Separate handler functions for each command (clean separation) — 02-01
- Strikethrough formatting for completed tasks (~~text~~) — 02-01

**Issues Resolved:**
- Python executable not found in PATH on Windows → Used `py` launcher instead

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None - clean implementation with no shortcuts taken
